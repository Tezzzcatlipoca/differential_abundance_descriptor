**Authors:** [Your Name(s) and Affiliation(s)]

**Abstract:** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the joints. Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of the microbiome in RA pathogenesis. This review focuses on the microbiome of RA, specifically examining the interplay of bacterial species and their associated genes, biochemical pathways, and potential impact on disease development and progression. We analyze data from recent studies to identify key bacterial species involved in RA, focusing on their gene expression patterns and functional roles.

**Introduction:**

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting millions worldwide. While the exact etiology of RA remains elusive, accumulating evidence highlights the crucial role of the gut microbiome in its pathogenesis. The microbiome, comprising the trillions of microbes residing within our bodies, plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including immune regulation, metabolism, and host defense. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition and function of the microbiome, has been implicated in a range of diseases, including RA. This review explores the role of specific bacterial species and their associated gene expression patterns in RA, drawing upon findings from recent research.

**Methods:**

This review synthesizes findings from recent studies investigating the microbiome in RA. The data presented in this review is based on the table provided, which summarizes key findings from the following studies:

* **Temporomandibular joint function, periodontal health, and oral microbiome in early rheumatoid arthritis and at-risk individuals: a prospective cohort study protocol** (2)
* **Differential effects of periodontal microbiome on the rheumatoid factor induction during rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis** (3)
* **Impact of humid climate on rheumatoid arthritis faecal microbiome and metabolites** (4)

* **Fecal microbiota transplantation from patients with rheumatoid arthritis causes depression-like behaviors in mice through abnormal T cells activation** (9)
* **A high-fiber diet synergizes with Prevotella copri and exacerbates rheumatoid arthritis** (10)
* **Influence of Helicobacter pylori infection on risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a nationwide population-based study** (11)
* **Genetic evidence for causal effects of leukocyte counts on risk for rheumatoid arthritis** (12)
* **Jmjd1c demethylates STAT3 to restrain plasma cell differentiation and rheumatoid arthritis** (13)
* **The association between dietary intake of branched-chain amino acids and odds and severity of rheumatoid arthritis** (14)
* **Detection and characterization of bacterial nucleic acids in culture-negative synovial tissue and fluid samples from rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis patients** (15) 

**Results and Discussion:**

The table provided outlines the expression patterns of genes from specific bacterial species associated with RA, highlighting their potential functional roles. 

* **Bacteroides fragilis:** This bacterium, belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum, exhibits overexpression of the butyryl-CoA CoA-transferase gene (GO:0006084). This gene is involved in the biosynthesis of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) known to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. However, the observed overexpression of this gene in individuals with hypertension suggests a potential link between B. fragilis and hypertensive conditions, which may indirectly impact RA development (1).  Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms by which B. fragilis contributes to both hypertension and RA.

* **Escherichia coli:**  This bacterium from the Proteobacteria phylum exhibits underexpression of the LacZ gene (GO:0004565), involved in lactose catabolism.  While the underexpression of this gene doesn't directly link to RA, it signifies potential changes in the gut microbiome's metabolic function. This underexpression may lead to alterations in the gut microbiome's composition and function, indirectly contributing to RA pathogenesis (14). 

* **Lactobacillus plantarum:** This bacterium from the Firmicutes phylum exhibits overexpression of the ldh gene (GO:0004459), involved in lactate biosynthesis. Lactate is a crucial metabolite produced by gut bacteria, influencing various cellular processes.  The overexpression of this gene in healthy individuals suggests a potential link between L. plantarum and immune homeostasis (5).  Further research is needed to understand how L. plantarum may contribute to maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and potentially protecting against RA development.

* **Streptococcus mutans:** This bacterium from the Firmicutes phylum exhibits overexpression of the gtfB gene (GO:0009101), involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. These polysaccharides contribute to biofilm formation, which can lead to dental caries.  The presence of this bacterium and its associated gene expression in the oral microbiome of individuals with dental caries suggests a potential link between oral microbiome dysbiosis and RA development (4). 

**Conclusion:**

This review highlights the complex interplay between bacterial species, their gene expression patterns, and RA pathogenesis. Further research is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which these bacteria and their associated genes contribute to RA development and progression. This understanding is crucial for developing targeted microbiome-based therapies for RA.  Future research should focus on investigating the specific role of these bacterial species in different stages of RA, evaluating the potential of modulating their activity to improve disease management, and exploring the potential of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a therapeutic approach for RA.
