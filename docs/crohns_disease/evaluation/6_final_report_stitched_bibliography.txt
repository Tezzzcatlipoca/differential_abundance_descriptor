The bibliography provided in the scientific report "The Gut Microbiome and Crohn's Disease: A Comprehensive Review" includes relevant and appropriate sources that contribute to the understanding of the topic. The references cited cover a range of topics related to Crohn's disease, the gut microbiome, gene expression, and bacterial species, providing a comprehensive overview of the subject matter.

Some key references that are missing from the bibliography include:

1. Sokol H, Leducq V, Aschard H, Pham HP, Jegou S, Landman C, et al. Fungal microbiota dysbiosis in IBD. Gut. 2017;66(6):1039-48.
2. Gevers D, Kugathasan S, Denson LA, Vazquez-Baeza Y, Van Treuren W, Ren B, et al. The treatment-naive microbiome in new-onset Crohn's disease. Cell Host Microbe. 2014;15(3):382-92.
3. Halfvarson J, Brislawn CJ, Lamendella R, VÃ¡zquez-Baeza Y, Walters WA, Bramer LM, et al. Dynamics of the human gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease. Nat Microbiol. 2017;2:17004.

These additional references could provide further insights into the microbial dysbiosis associated with Crohn's disease and the role of the gut microbiome in disease pathogenesis.

Overall, the bibliography is relevant and supports the information presented in the scientific report on the gut microbiome and Crohn's disease.
