The bibliography section of the attached scientific report is not provided in detail, as it only includes a general instruction to list cited papers with full citations. However, based on the content of the report, it is crucial to include references to recent studies that have investigated the microbiome in the context of C. Some key references that should be included in the bibliography are:

1. A study that reported an increased abundance of *Clostridium difficile* in individuals with C and its role in the disease.
2. A study that observed a decrease in *Salmonella enterica* in individuals with C and its potential impact.
3. Papers discussing the overexpression of *beta-lactamase* in *Escherichia coli*, under-expression of *penicillin-binding protein* in *Staphylococcus aureus*, overexpression of *toxin A* in *Clostridium difficile*, and overexpression of *butyryl-CoA CoA-transferase* in *Bacteroides fragilis in the context of C.
4. A study demonstrating the potential of utilizing 'omics-driven computational metabolic network models for identifying metabolic shifts associated with C.
5. References to relevant therapeutic interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), dietary changes, and probiotic supplements for treating C.
6. Any other studies or reviews that provide valuable insights into the microbiome's role in C and potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

It is essential to ensure that the cited papers are recent, relevant, and contribute significantly to the understanding of the microbiome in the context of C. Additionally, the bibliography should be formatted correctly according to the chosen citation style to maintain academic integrity.
