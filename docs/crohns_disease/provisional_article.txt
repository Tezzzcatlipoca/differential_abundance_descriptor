##  Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by recurrent inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily affecting the terminal ileum and colon [1]. The etiology of CD remains complex and multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and an aberrant immune response to the gut microbiota [2]. The gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem of trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gastrointestinal tract, plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and modulating immune responses [3]. In the context of CD, the gut microbiome exhibits significant dysbiosis, characterized by an altered composition and function, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease [4].

This review delves into the intricate interplay between the gut microbiome and CD, examining a comprehensive dataset encompassing various bacterial species, gene expression profiles, and associated metabolic pathways. We aim to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets within the gut microbiome that could be exploited for the development of novel interventions for CD.

The analysis highlights the dysregulation of _Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis_ (MAP) in the context of CD.  MAP is a slow-growing, intracellular bacterium that causes Johne's disease, a chronic granulomatous enteritis primarily affecting ruminants [5]. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, the presence of MAP in CD patients suggests a potential link between these two conditions, raising intriguing questions about the role of this bacterium in human disease. 

Furthermore, our investigation reveals significant alterations in gene expression across various bacterial species, including _Escherichia coli_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and _Clostridium difficile_. These findings provide a solid foundation for future research exploring the possibility of targeting specific bacterial species or their associated genes to develop novel therapeutic approaches for CD.

The research presented in this review underscores the critical role of the gut microbiome in modulating host health and its immense potential as a therapeutic target for complex diseases like CD. Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiome and the host immune system in the context of CD is essential for developing effective treatments and improving patient outcomes.
