The bibliography provided in the scientific report titled "The Gut Microbiome and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review of Key Findings" is relevant and appropriate to the overall topic. The three key references cited are from reputable sources in the field of microbiology and gastroenterology, providing a solid foundation for the review's discussion on the gut microbiome and its relationship to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

However, there are some significant papers or key references that could enhance the bibliography and provide additional depth to the discussion. Some additional references that could be included to further support the findings and discussion in the review are:

1. Jeffery IB, O'Toole PW, Öhman L, et al. An irritable bowel syndrome subtype defined by species-specific alterations in faecal microbiota. Gut. 2012;61(7):997-1006.
2. Rigsbee L, Agans R, Shankar V, et al. Quantitative profiling of gut microbiota of children with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Am J Gastroenterol. 2012;107(11):1740-1751.
3. Tap J, Derrien M, Törnblom H, et al. Identification of an intestinal microbiota signature associated with severity of irritable bowel syndrome. Gastroenterology. 2017;152(1):111-123.

Including these additional references would provide a more comprehensive overview of the current research landscape on the gut microbiome and IBS, further strengthening the review's argument and insights.
