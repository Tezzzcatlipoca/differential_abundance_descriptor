The bibliography of the scientific report on "The Microbiome in Irritable Bowel Syndrome" is crucial in determining the relevance and credibility of the study. Unfortunately, the references section is not provided in the text. However, based on the information presented in the report, it is evident that the study relies on data from multiple research studies focusing on the gut microbiome in individuals with IBS. 

To evaluate the relevance of the bibliography, it is essential to ensure that the sources cited are appropriate and pertinent to the subject matter. The references should include key studies that have contributed significantly to the understanding of the gut microbiome in IBS, gene expression patterns, and functional pathways.

Key references that should be included in the bibliography may encompass seminal papers in the field of microbiome research, studies focusing on gut dysbiosis in IBS patients, research on gene expression profiling in the gut microbiome, and investigations into the pathophysiology of IBS. Some notable papers that could be included are:

1. Ford AC, Lacy BE, Talley NJ. Irritable bowel syndrome. N Engl J Med. 2017;376(26):2566-2578. doi: 10.1056/NEJMra1607548
2. Jeffery IB, O'Toole PW, Ã–hman L, et al. An irritable bowel syndrome subtype defined by species-specific alterations in faecal microbiota. Gut. 2012;61(7):997-1006. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301501
3. Zhuang X, Xiong L, Li L, Li M, Chen M. Alterations of gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis. J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2017;32(1):28-38. doi: 10.1111/jgh.13471
4. Rigsbee L, Agans R, Shankar V, et al. Quantitative profiling of gut microbiota of children with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Am J Gastroenterol. 2012;107(11):1740-1751. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2012.287

These references cover a range of topics related to the gut microbiome, gene expression, dysbiosis, and IBS pathophysiology, which are central to the study's objectives. By including such key papers in the bibliography, the report would demonstrate a strong foundation in the existing literature and enhance the credibility of the findings presented.

In conclusion, the bibliography of the scientific report on the microbiome in IBS should include relevant and significant references that support the study's aims and findings. By incorporating key studies in the field, the report can strengthen its scientific basis and provide valuable insights into the role of the gut microbiome in IBS pathogenesis.
