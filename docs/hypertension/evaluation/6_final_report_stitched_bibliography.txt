Overall, the bibliography of the scientific report "The Gut Microbiome and Hypertension: A Review" appears to be relevant and appropriate to the topic at hand. The sources cited cover a range of aspects related to the gut microbiome, hypertension, dysbiosis, bacterial species, inflammation, oxidative stress, and potential therapeutic interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). 

However, there are some key references that are missing from the bibliography that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the review:

1. **Reference for Bacteroides fragilis study:** While the report mentions the increased abundance of *Bacteroides fragilis* in hypertensive individuals and its role in butyrate biosynthesis, a specific reference to the study would provide readers with more detailed information and support for this claim.

2. **Reference for butyrate and blood pressure:** Since butyrate is highlighted as a key metabolite produced by the gut microbiota that plays a role in regulating inflammation and blood pressure, citing a specific study or review on this topic would strengthen the discussion on the mechanisms involved.

3. **Reference for Escherichia coli and hypertension:** The report mentions that *Escherichia coli* is overrepresented in hypertensive individuals and may contribute to hypertension through inflammation and oxidative stress. Providing a reference to a study supporting this claim would add credibility to the argument.

4. **Reference for Streptococcus mutans and hypertension:** Similar to *Escherichia coli*, citing a specific study or research article that links *Streptococcus mutans* to hypertension and its mechanisms of action would be beneficial.

5. **References for probiotics, prebiotics, and FMT and hypertension:** While the report mentions the potential therapeutic interventions of probiotics, prebiotics, and FMT for managing hypertension, specific references to studies or clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy in this context would be valuable.

Including these missing key references would provide readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape regarding the gut microbiome and hypertension, and strengthen the overall credibility of the review.
